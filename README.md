1033 Program College Equipment
==============================
Military equipment transfer data to nearly all colleges in the United States. This gear comes via the Department of Defense's 1033 Program. This is a master file of several different datasets from various colleges and state agencies.

<b>Important:</b> For this dataset, an emphasis was placed on tracking equipment currently in the possession of colleges. For instance, the Univ. of Wyoming returned two M-14s to the federal government in 2013. As they currently have no equipment from the 1033 Program in their inventory, they are not included in this dataset.

Per the New York Times, "this data does not represent all of the military-style gear that law enforcement agencies have. Agencies also purchase equipment with their own money or with federal grants."

<b>Received full or college-only datasets from:</b>

ARIZONA, ARKANSAS, CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, CONNECTICUT, DELAWARE, FLORIDA, GEORGIA, ILLINOIS, INDIANA, IOWA, KANSAS, KENTUCKY, MAINE, MARYLAND, MINNESOTA, MISSISSIPPI, MISSOURI, NEW MEXICO, NORTH DAKOTA, OHIO, OKLAHOMA, SOUTH CAROLINA, TENNESSEE, TEXAS, WASHINGTON STATE, WISCONSIN, NEW YORK

<b>No colleges currently participating in the program in these states:</b>

ALASKA, HAWAII, IDAHO, MONTANA, NEBRASKA, NEVADA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, NEW JERSEY, OREGON, PENNSYLVANIA, SOUTH DAKOTA, UTAH, VERMONT, WEST VIRGINIA, WYOMING

<b>Where we stand with requests:</b>

Transfers for colleges in ALABAMA, LOUISIANA, MASSACHUSETTS, MICHIGAN, NORTH CAROLINA, VIRGINIA, RHODE ISLAND, AND WASHINGTON, DC remain in play. All of these states have either declined my requests for datasets or claimed the are not in possession of the requested records. Appeals are in order, but to sidestep this issue, I have requested the rosters of the 1033 Program participants from these various states. With these lists, I have located the colleges that currently participate in the 1033 Program. I then request equipment inventories from the colleges directly. The equipment you see from Virginia colleges was provided via this method.

ALABAMA
- Jacksonville State University declined to release figures for tactical equipment procurements, citing campus security
- Oakland University, a private institution, did not respond to requests for the release of 1033 Program information
- Bevill State Community College says it is under no obligation to provide documents related to the 1033 Program, as the requesting organization and individual are not stationed in Alabama.

NORTH CAROLINA
- The General Administration of the UNC System disclosed non-tactical equipment procured by public colleges in North Carolina. Citing security concerns, however, the administration declined to release data on the transfer of tactical equipment to these colleges, instead using the term "UNC-constituent institution/associated entity" to release equipment data but not agency data.
- Louisburg College, a private institution, did not respond to requests for the release of 1033 Program information

VIRGINIA

RHODE ISLAND + LOUISIANA + WASHINGTON, DC
